Hello! Welcome to my NFL Touchdown Detection Project!

1.) Make sure you are in the correct directory.

2.) You must install requirments.txt to be able to run the code 

3.) In this demo you will run the code by typing in your terminal: 
python detect.py 

3.) You will be able to view the deliverables in the two docs after running:
test_felicia_results.docx
test_nfl_results.docx

Also take note of messages in ur terminal! Also ensure you have docx extension, if not just download and look at them!

These will show the analysis of the results on the test set and the NFL set

Note! Snapshots from the NFL were screenshotted from:
